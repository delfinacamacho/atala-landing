# Atala Prism - Landing page challenge using React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), as is the recomended solution to start building a new **single-page application** in React.

## Resources & technologies
- React.js
- styled-components
- react-icons
- react-badges

## How to install

### 1 - Clone the repository
Clone the [repository](https://github.com/delfinacamacho/delilah-resto) manually, or directly from the the terminal using this command:

`git clone https://github.com/delfinacamacho/delilah-resto.`

### 2 - Install dependencies

```
npm install
```
or, if you are using yarn

```
yarn install
```

### 3 - Commands
Command scripts can be found in the package.json file.

To run the project locally, use
```
npm start
```
or 
```
yarn start
```

To build the app for production use 
```
npm run build
```
or 
```
yarn run build
```
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. The app is ready to be deployed!

## Tech Debt
- Index and folders refactoring
- Adding Unit Tests
- Trying different animations to ease in/out the different sections.
